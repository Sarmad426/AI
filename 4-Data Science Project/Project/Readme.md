# Steps for an **ML/Data Science** Project

## 1. Import data

You can use libraries like pandas to import data from a CSV file.

## 2. Clean and prepare data

This may involve removing duplicates, handling missing entries, and converting text data to numerical values.

## 3. Split data into training and testing sets

The training data is used to train the model, and the testing data is used to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## 4. Select a model and train it

There are many different machine learning algorithms available, such as decision trees and neural networks. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem you are trying to solve.

## 4. Evaluate the model

This involves measuring the accuracy of the model's predictions on the testing data.

## 5. Fine-tune the model

If the model is not accurate enough, you may need to fine-tune the parameters of the model or select a different algorithm.

## Calculating Model Accuracy

Split data set into two sets.

- Training
- Testing

A general rule of thumb is to allocate 70-80% of data for training and 20-30% data for testing. Then we pass data set we have for testing, we will get the prediction and compare this predictions with actual values in the test set, based on that we can calculate the model accuracy.
